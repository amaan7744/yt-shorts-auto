UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld died in 1961 when his DC-6 crashed in Northern Rhodesia. The film posits that this crash was not an accident. It suggests involvement from a South African white supremacist group. The investigation leads to a Belgian-British mercenary pilot, Jan van Risseghem, who may have shot down the plane. Witnesses emerge, revealing ties to a secretive organization. Yet, many questions remain unanswered about the true circumstances of Hammarskj\u00f6ld's death.", "uploaded_at": "2026-01-04T21:45:54.401924"}
