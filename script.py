CRITICAL TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write like a forensic investigator presenting evidence
- Every word carries weight
- No dramatic flourishes or emotional language
- State facts that make the audience lean in
- Use complete, detailed sentences with SPECIFIC information
- Create weight through WHAT you say, not HOW you say it

CASE TYPE: {case_type.replace('_', ' ').title()}

Generate EXACTLY 5 LINES (lines 2-6 of the full script):

LINE 2 - FACTS (MUST BE 16-20 WORDS, 5-6 seconds):
State: Full name, exact location with city and state, specific date, exact time.
Format: "[Full Name]. [City, State]. [Full Date]. [Time with AM/PM]."
Example: "Rebecca Zahau. Coronado, California. July 13th, 2011. 6:48 AM."
CRITICAL: Include middle name if available. Include full state name. Be specific.
MINIMUM 16 words required.

LINE 3 - CONTEXT (MUST BE 18-22 WORDS, 6-7 seconds):
Who they were. Their specific role. Their exact connection. What they were doing. Why it matters.
Example: "The girlfriend of a pharmaceutical executive. Found hanging naked from a balcony in his mansion. Just two days after his son's fatal accident."
NO generic descriptions. Specific job titles, relationships, circumstances.
MINIMUM 18 words required.

LINE 4 - CONTRADICTION (MUST BE 24-28 WORDS, 8-9 seconds):
The ONE detail that doesn't fit. State the contradiction with FULL context and implications.
State it like presenting evidence in court. Make it impossible to ignore.
Example: "Her hands were bound behind her back with red rope. Her feet were bound at the ankles. Her mouth was not gagged. The San Diego County Sheriff ruled it suicide."
This line should make the viewer's stomach drop.
MINIMUM 24 words required. Add specific details about HOW things don't fit.

LINE 5 - OFFICIAL STORY (MUST BE 24-28 WORDS, 8-9 seconds):
What authorities concluded. What evidence they cited or ignored. What happened next. The current status.
State it factually with full context, let the contradiction with LINE 4 speak for itself.
Example: "The San Diego County Sheriff ruled it suicide within five days. No charges were filed against anyone. The family hired independent forensic pathologists. Their findings contradicted the official report completely."
MINIMUM 24 words required. Include timeline, ruling, and aftermath.

LINE 6 - CTA (MUST BE EXACT):
"{cta_text}"

CASE DATA:
Name: {case['full_name']}
Location: {case['location']}
Date: {case['date']}
Time: {case['time']}
Summary: {case['summary']}
Key Detail: {case['key_detail']}
Official Story: {case['official_story']}

CRITICAL WORD COUNT RULES:
- Line 2: MINIMUM 16 words (if less, ADD more location/time specifics)
- Line 3: MINIMUM 18 words (if less, ADD more context about who they were)
- Line 4: MINIMUM 24 words (if less, ADD more details about the contradiction)
- Line 5: MINIMUM 24 words (if less, ADD timeline, aftermath, investigation status)

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT LENGTH (Line 4 - 27 words):
"Her hands were bound behind her back with red rope. Her feet were bound together at the ankles. Her mouth was left completely ungagged. The medical examiner ruled it suicide."

EXAMPLE OF TOO SHORT (Line 4 - 15 words):
"Her hands were bound. Her feet were bound. The sheriff called it suicide."

YOU MUST MATCH THE LONGER EXAMPLE STYLE.

Write ONLY the 5 lines (2-6), nothing else. No labels, no numbering:
